# Head In The Game
Head in the game is an app created for the 2022 [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/). 
Our goal in creating this app was to create an app that helps kids - especially those with conditions such as ADHD - better manage their schedule and learn the valuable life lesson of time management.
# Using Head In The Game

### Taks Screen
The tasks sreen is where the user can manage all of their tasks. 

To add a task the user needs to click on the "Add Task" button. Text boxes then appear which prompt the user to enter the necesary info for each task - a title, a brief description, the priority for the task, the date the task needs to be done, the time it needs to be done, and the amount of time necesary to complete the task. When the user hits the "Done" button, the task is automatically saved to the JSON file and the user is taken back to the tasks screen.

To complete or delete a task the user clicks on the "Complete Task" button. The user is then propted to tell the program which task should be deleted. The program will then delete that task from the JSON fie and bring the user back to the tasks screen.

### Schedule Screen
The schedule screen is where the user can view their schedule. Head In The Game organizes the tasks and displays them to the user. The first tasks to be displayed are tasks whose due dates have passed. Those are displayed in another color (pink) to make them stand out to the user. The rest of the tasks are then displayed with higher priority tasks being displayed first.

### Home Screen
The home screen has three main sections: the calendar, the tasks, and the schedule.

The calendar is a calendar of the current month. The tasks section shows the oldest tasks so the user knows what tasks they have been delaying or putting off. The schedule section shows the next few tasks on the schedule so the user knows what tasks they have to complete next. The date and time are also shown in the top left corner.

### Notifications
While it doesn't have a dedicated screen, the notifications are the biggest feature of our app. Head In The Game notifies the user when it is time for them to complete a task. This helps the user stay focused and stop procrastination. At the start of the program, Head In The Game will also send one notification reminding the user what tasks are overdue. This keeps the user from putting off tasks that they don't want to do.
